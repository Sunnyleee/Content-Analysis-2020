      "Content analysis is a research method for studying documents and communication artifacts, which might be texts of various formats, pictures, audio or video. Social scientists use content analysis to examine patterns in communication in a replicable and systematic manner.[1] One of the key advantages of using content analysis to analyse social phenomena is its non-invasive nature, in contrast to simulating social experiences or collecting survey answers.\n",

They all involve systematic reading or observation of texts or artifacts which are assigned labels (sometimes called codes) to indicate the presence of interesting, meaningful pieces of content.[2][3] By systematically labeling the content of a set of texts, researchers can analyse patterns of content quantitatively using statistical methods, or use qualitative methods to analyse meanings of content within texts.\n",

Simple computational techniques can provide descriptive data such as word frequencies and document lengths. Machine learning classifiers can greatly increase the number of texts that can be labeled, but the scientific utility of doing so is a matter of debate. Further, numerous computer-aided text analysis (CATA) computer programs are available that analyze text for pre-determined linguistic, semantic, and psychological characteristics.[4]\n",

       " \"WOW. I wasn't sure what to expect here considering I'm not a huge fan of most fusion food (it's usually too American-ized). We made this reservation the maximum days in advance (in the morning, because they usually fill up by the middle/end of the day) and got a spot on a Monday evening. We were early for our reservation but the party occupying our table hung out for awhile, so we didn't get seated until 10m or so past our designated time. The restaurant decor is beautiful, but the layout is funky. The main pathway between the tables and the bar when you're walking towards the back is just slightly too narrow for two people to walk by each other at the same time. The bathroom is down a set of stairs. The kitchen design is open, and situated near the back of the restaurant.We were so excited to come here, we ordered as many things as possible:- tuna poke - wow. tuna was high quality and that nori cracker was something I've never had before. It was thick but incredibly crisp/crunchy, I imagine it's hard to get it to be this texture- beef tongue - their version of bao, not a huge fan and probably wouldn't order again. The flavor and texture of the tongue just wasn't working for me.- yellowtail sashimi - very similar to what I expected but also very delicious, might order again- tuna belly - I somehow was expecting this to come out cold and raw. It came out hot and cooked so my expectations were misaligned with reality. It seemed like high quality tuna but I'm not a huge fan of cooked tuna.. unless it's a tuna salad sandwich :).- scallops - absolutely delicious, the entire dish was not only beautifully presented, but unique and inventive, with an array of textures that was absolutely delightful- roasted octopus - eh, it was fine- spam (hidden menu) - I've never had homemade spam before and this was well worth it. It tasted like kielbasa sausage and was so packed with flavor. Don't go here without trying this. - manila clams - one of the best dishes we ordered. The sauce that it's in is similar to a Thai soup/curry and is delectable. The naan it comes with is surprisingly some of the best naan I've never had (it tastes homemade, it's so ridiculously soft). I'm not a huge clam person but we ordered this because one of my friends is.. and I would absolutely order this again. - beef ribs - again, not a huge fan of ribs but wow, these were tender, flavorful and this is another must-try on the menu.For desert, we had that pineapple thing that everyone gets. It was good, but nothing amazing - we were also stuffed at this point, we overordered (no regrets) since we only had 3 people and ordered all the dishes above... service was great, in addition.This place is insanely hard to get in to, and definitely on the expensive side, but worth a visit if you can get in. Just plan in advance.\",\n",

Then you have to wait in line and wish for good luck. Stop complaining. Don't want to line up? Go to the mall. You really want certain drop? Go to eBay. It's blessed enough no need to go to LA. If you are not big into Supreme. Just want to check it out because it's super famous. Avoid Thursday and Friday.Staffs are friendly. Be nice and be polite to them. Don't lose your manner from waiting. Yeah it's in a bad neighborhood. That's the charm of San Francisco. Deal with it.( Actually their LA location is way worse than SF. The amount of hustling and harassing people do near LA Supreme store make SF tenderloin looks like a beautiful place with beautiful people )( This location is great. Supreme is more than a street fashion and skateboard brand. It's a culture, a game and a belief. \\xa0Market street is a wonderful area for Supreme. Perfect amount chaos and vivid living breath. If you can't deal with this then... what else I can say? Go to mall. )( Tenderloin is the essential of SF. Stop hating this neighborhood. I love it. Very iconic location for Supreme to open.

They have a traditional Thai items on the menu along with unique items. We ordered two dishes based on the servers recommendations and were both very satisfied with what we ate: - Yum Moon and Goong: a salad with crispy pork belly, sliced apples, prawns and nuts. This dish has the perfect marriage of textures and flavors, from crispy, to crunchy, sweet, spicy and refreshing. - Crab fried Rice: served on a whole young coconut! They do not skim out on the crab and add plenty of eggs. Wasn't overly oily or salty. Awesome \\xa0dish! PS: their fruit infused water is effin DELICIOUS. SERVICE: Mind readers! Before I was able to ask if we can move to a different table away from the direct sunlight - the server offered. Before I can ask if they can remove the humongous weave basket the fried rice came in; the server offered. Before I can ask for a water refill, the server offered. And need I say more about asking for the bill? AMBIENCE:Very spacious and bright and hip. The only complaint I have is that the space lacks circulation and can be a bit stuffy.

At least there aren\\'t Edison Bulbs, lord, I\\'ve grown tired of Edison Bulbs. It\\'s nice to have an empty storefront filled by locals on a block which is notable for a peculiar sort of San Franciscan urban decay, where everything is desirable, but nothing is rented.The food (or what I tried of it) is good. A very of-the-moment Nashville-Styled fried chicken sandwich was appropriately hair-raising, with a calming vinegar-based slaw and surprisingly durable challah bun. Chicken doesn\\'t money-shot like a burger does, but the presentation will likely titilate the instant-gram crowd. The salad with Kale, Brussels, and Tomato was a shockingly good call, properly mixing the roughage my mother always wanted me to eat in a well-balanced salty, fatty, and acidic blend. Beers are local (generally) with a good mixture of lower alcohol (a 4.9% pale ale as well as Artisan\\'s \"Prairie BOMB\" at 12%). Service? Still getting used to things, but I went within the first hour.Are these guys going to last? Probably. The Richmond Republic folk know what they\\'re doing. Will I be going back? Likely, if I can get a seat at the beautifully stained bar. Five Stars (tenatively): Foghorn fills a niche on this stretch of Balboa with craft beer and properly done protein. The opening day crowd seems to suggest that it was a well-thought-out business move.Transit Accessible: 31 Balboa, 44-O\\'Shaugnnesy, 38/38R-GearyA cute name: in honor of the foghorns we hear on socked in days as well as the name of a certain famous chicken.\\n            Was this review …?\\n    \\nNicole H. wrote a review for     Dandelion Chocolate - Ferry Building\\nI eat a lot of dark chocolate, and I\\'m not sure if it\\'s because they tell you exactly what you\\'re supposed to be tasting in each bar, or whether it\\'s because the beans used in these bars are so different from one another, but you really do taste the flavors they\\'re labeled with!Service was friendly and prompt. They had a bunch of samples here, just like they do at their Valencia location.\\n            Was this review …?\\n    \\nNova P. wrote a review for     Dottie’s True Blue Cafe\\nUnless you are an early riser, I recommend to add yourself on a waitlist available through Yelp to avoid a long wait. While I used that option we ended up waiting nearly an hour as they won\\'t seat unless your entire party is there. The waiting experience was excruciating but the food and live jazz band made up for it. There were quite a number of specials and sweet baked treat options. My group all ordered their own \\xa0savory dish and split one pancake between four (it\\'s large). I picked \\xa0the delicious black bean cake breakfast which was a nice vegetarian option. The home red potatoes were cooked perfectly. I washed it down with a nice brut rose. I also had a helping of my friend\\'s French toast and bacon, both were worth the extra calories!The one disappointing item agreed by my group was the grilled cheddar cornbread. I didn\\'t taste much cheddar and it was dry. Perhaps it was just the batch we got. Overall we were quite satisfied with our food, ambiance and chill music for a Sunday brunch.\\n            Was this review …?\\n    \\nKatie Y. wrote a review for     Liholiho Yacht Club\\nWOW. I wasn\\'t sure what to expect here considering I\\'m not a huge fan of most fusion food (it\\'s usually too American-ized). We made this reservation the maximum days in advance (in the morning, because they usually fill up by the middle/end of the day) and got a spot on a Monday evening. We were early for our reservation but the party occupying our table hung out for awhile, so we didn\\'t get seated until 10m or so past our designated time. The restaurant decor is beautiful, but the layout is funky. The main pathway between the tables and the bar when you\\'re walking towards the back is just slightly too narrow for two people to walk by each other at the same time. The bathroom is down a set of stairs. The kitchen design is open, and situated near the back of the restaurant.We were so excited to come here, we ordered as many things as possible:- tuna poke - wow. tuna was high quality and that nori cracker was something I\\'ve never had before. It was thick but incredibly crisp/crunchy, I imagine it\\'s hard to get it to be this texture- beef tongue - their version of bao, not a huge fan and probably wouldn\\'t order again. The flavor and texture of the tongue just wasn\\'t working for me.- yellowtail sashimi - very similar to what I expected but also very delicious, might order again- tuna belly - I somehow was expecting this to come out cold and raw. It came out hot and cooked so my expectations were misaligned with reality. It seemed like high quality tuna but I\\'m not a huge fan of cooked tuna.. unless it\\'s a tuna salad sandwich :).- scallops - absolutely delicious, the entire dish was not only beautifully presented, but unique and inventive, with an array of textures that was absolutely delightful- roasted octopus - eh, it was fine- spam (hidden menu) - I\\'ve never had homemade spam before and this was well worth it. It tasted like kielbasa sausage and was so packed with flavor. Don\\'t go here without trying this. - manila clams - one of the best dishes we ordered. The sauce that it\\'s in is similar to a Thai soup/curry and is delectable. The naan it comes with is surprisingly some of the best naan I\\'ve never had (it tastes homemade, it\\'s so ridiculously soft). I\\'m not a huge clam person but we ordered this because one of my friends is.. and I would absolutely order this again. - beef ribs - again, not a huge fan of ribs but wow, these were tender, flavorful and this is another must-try on the menu.For desert, we had that pineapple thing that everyone gets. It was good, but nothing amazing - we were also stuffed at this point, we overordered (no regrets) since we only had 3 people and ordered all the dishes above... service was great, in addition.This place is insanely hard to get in to, and definitely on the expensive side, but worth a visit if you can get in. Just plan in advance.\\n            Was this review …?\\n    \\nHana H. wrote a review for     Supreme\\nYou got to line up. It\\'s Supreme. What are you expecting? If you can\\'t wake up in the morning and cop the drop you like in 10 seconds online. Then you have to wait in line and wish for good luck. Stop complaining. Don\\'t want to line up? Go to the mall. You really want certain drop? Go to eBay. It\\'s blessed enough no need to go to LA. If you are not big into Supreme. Just want to check it out because it\\'s super famous. Avoid Thursday and Friday.Staffs are friendly. Be nice and be polite to them. Don\\'t lose your manner from waiting. Yeah it\\'s in a bad neighborhood. That\\'s the charm of San Francisco. Deal with it.( Actually their LA location is way worse than SF. The amount of hustling and harassing people do near LA Supreme store make SF tenderloin looks like a beautiful place with beautiful people )( This location is great. Supreme is more than a street fashion and skateboard brand. It\\'s a culture, a game and a belief. \\xa0Market street is a wonderful area for Supreme. Perfect amount chaos and vivid living breath. If you can\\'t deal with this then... what else I can say? Go to mall. )( Tenderloin is the essential of SF. Stop hating this neighborhood. I love it. Very iconic location for Supreme to open. Good choice )\\n            Was this review …?\\n    \\nSamantha F. wrote a review for     Sun and Moon\\nNew Thai spot in SOMA area with a open space with plenty of sunlight from the abundance of windows lining the wall. FOOD:My BFF and I came here on a Thurs night and there was no wait. They have a traditional Thai items on the menu along with unique items. We ordered two dishes based on the servers recommendations and were both very satisfied with what we ate: - Yum Moon and Goong: a salad with crispy pork belly, sliced apples, prawns and nuts. This dish has the perfect marriage of textures and flavors, from crispy, to crunchy, sweet, spicy and refreshing. - Crab fried Rice: served on a whole young coconut! They do not skim out on the crab and add plenty of eggs. Wasn\\'t overly oily or salty. Awesome \\xa0dish! PS: their fruit infused water is effin DELICIOUS. SERVICE: Mind readers! Before I was able to ask if we can move to a different table away from the direct sunlight - the server offered. Before I can ask if they can remove the humongous weave basket the fried rice came in; the server offered. Before I can ask for a water refill, the server offered. And need I say more about asking for the bill? AMBIENCE:Very spacious and bright and hip. The only complaint I have is that the space lacks circulation and can be a bit stuffy. Would return for other items!\\n            Was this review …?\\n    \\nLeah E. wrote a review for     Underdogs Too\\nI JUST MOVED TO SF AND THIS IS A 4 MINUTE WALK FROM MY HOUSE... dreams do come true. Happy Hour M-F from 4-6 $4 margaritas (fresh squeezed limes) $3 tecate and $2 tacos. They also have a late night happy hour Tuesday-Saturday 10:30 pm- 12 am. The meat is top quality and the portions are insane. I recently ordered pollo asado nachos and they could\\'ve fed 4 people. I\\'ve also had the carnitas and carne asada tacos and it is hard to choose which meat is my favorite. They have a super spicy salsa that you have to ask for and it\\'s FIRE! *Nicks Way is a crunchy and soft shell taco that includes cheese and guacamole. One is a whole meal by itself. The Baja fish taco is hands down the best I\\'ve ever had. All the bartenders here are legit and there\\'s a steady flow of patrons and to go orders. They have a special Saturday/Sunday brunch menu that begins at 9 am and I can\\'t wait to check it out!\\n            Was this review …?\\n    \\nCorinna T. wrote a review for     Vintage Cafe\\nIf you\\'re looking for a bougey brunch with amazing aesthetic, look no further. Food and decor are instaworthy here, and the location is nestled in of course, the Marina district.This is U Story\\'s second restaurant, the first being a dessert house located in the Mission. They serve brunch AND dessert here. Reservations are recommended through Yelp because weekends get crowded.Favorites: -omurice: an omelette that oozes with sauce and rice inside -crepe cakes: flavors rotate, but I\\'ve tried the Thai tea and coconut one -hojicha latte: served hot, and in a chaliceI took a girlfriend here for her birthday, and she was happy. Happy brunching!\\n            Was this review …?\\n    \\nDenise C. wrote a review for     Noe Valley Bakery - West Portal\\nI have walked by Noe Valley Bakery at times and wanted to try it. They have a variety of pastries that look nice, but seem manufactured. I don\\'t know the story behind this bakery, but it\\'s appealing. It\\'s expensive and a tad bit overpriced. I decided to have a late lunch savory quiche with a small salad. The quiche was to be lorraine, but I got the veggie instead because they ran out. Getting through the line was a bit confusing, but they are nice and helpful. It\\'s a neat spot in West Portal. The quiche was a good snack before afternoon movie.\\n            Was this review …?\\n    \\nEmily T. wrote a review for     Golden Gate Bakery\\nFluffy flaky butter crust and a creamy eggy filling! I honestly love their egg tarts! 2.75 per egg tart or 33 for a dozen. They package them in pink boxes for you if you get the dozen. The last time I came they were freshly made and super yummy! Coming later in the day on the weekday there was barely any line!\\n            Was this review …?\\n    '"

      "</p>, <p>Computers are increasingly used in content analysis to automate the labeling (or coding) of documents. Simple computational techniques can provide descriptive data such as word frequencies and document lengths. <a href=\"/wiki/Machine_learning\" title=\"Machine learning\">Machine learning</a> classifiers can greatly increase the number of texts that can be labeled, but the scientific utility of doing so is a matter of debate. Further, numerous computer-aided text analysis (CATA) computer programs are available that analyze text for pre-determined linguistic, semantic, and psychological characteristics.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-Neuendorf2016_4-0\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Neuendorf2016-4\">[4]</a></sup>\n",
      "</p>, <p>Content analysis is best understood as a broad family of techniques. Effective researchers choose techniques that best help them answer their substantive questions. That said, according to <a href=\"/wiki/Klaus_Krippendorff\" title=\"Klaus Krippendorff\">Klaus Krippendorff</a>, six questions must be addressed in every content analysis:<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-Krippendorff2004_5-0\"><a href=\"#cite_note-Krippendorff2004-5\">[5]</a></sup>\n",
      "</p>, <p>The simplest and most objective form of content analysis considers unambiguous characteristics of the text such as <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/wiki/Word_frequencies\" title=\"Word frequencies\">word frequencies</a>, the page area taken by a newspaper column, or the duration of a <a href=\"/wiki/Radio\" title=\"Radio\">radio</a> or <a href=\"/wiki/Television\" title=\"Television\">television</a> program. Analysis of simple word frequencies is limited because the meaning of a word depends on surrounding text.  <a href=\"/wiki/Key_Word_in_Context\" title=\"Key Word in Context\">Key Word In Context</a> (KWIC) routines address this by placing words in their textual context. This helps resolve ambiguities such as those introduced by <a href=\"/wiki/Synonym\" title=\"Synonym\">synonyms</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Homonym\" title=\"Homonym\">homonyms</a>.\n",
      "</p>, <p>A further step in analysis is the distinction between dictionary-based (quantitative) approaches and qualitative approaches. Dictionary-based approaches set up a list of categories derived from the frequency list of words and control the distribution of words and their respective categories over the texts. While methods in quantitative content analysis in this way transform observations of found categories into quantitative statistical data, the qualitative content analysis focuses more on the intentionality and its implications. There are strong parallels between qualitative content analysis and <a href=\"/wiki/Thematic_analysis\" title=\"Thematic analysis\">thematic analysis</a>.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-6\"><a href=\"#cite_note-6\">[6]</a></sup>\n",

These coding categories are strictly relevant to the researcher's hypothesis. Quantitative analysis also takes a deductive approach.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-:1_8-0\"><a href=\"#cite_note-:1-8\">[8]</a></sup>\n",
      "</p>, <p><a href=\"/wiki/Siegfried_Kracauer\" title=\"Siegfried Kracauer\">Siegfried Kracauer</a> provides a critique of quantitative analysis, asserting that it oversimplifies complex communications in order to be more reliable. On the other hand, qualitative analysis deals with the intricacies of latent interpretations, whereas quantitative has a focus on manifest meanings. He also acknowledges an \"overlap\" of qualitative and quantitative content analysis.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-:03_9-0\"><a href=\"#cite_note-:03-9\">[9]</a></sup> Patterns are looked at more closely in qualitative analysis, and based on the latent meanings that the researcher may find, the course of the research could be changed. It is inductive and begins with open research questions, as opposed to a hypothesis.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-:12_10-0\"><a href=\"#cite_note-:12-10\">[10]</a></sup>\n",
      "</p>, <p>More generally, content analysis is research using the categorization and classification of speech, written text, interviews, images, or other forms of communication.  In its beginnings, using the first newspapers at the end of the 19th century, analysis was done manually by measuring the number of columns given a subject. The approach can also be traced back to a university student studying patterns in Shakespeare's literature in 1893.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-11\"><a href=\"#cite_note-11\">[11]</a></sup> With the rise of common computing facilities like PCs, computer-based methods of analysis are growing in popularity.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-12\"><a href=\"#cite_note-12\">[12]</a></sup><sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-13\"><a href=\"#cite_note-13\">[13]</a></sup><sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-14\"><a href=\"#cite_note-14\">[14]</a></sup> Answers to open ended questions, newspaper articles, political party manifestos, medical records or systematic observations in experiments can all be subject to systematic analysis of textual data.\n",
      "</p>, <p>By having contents of communication available in form of machine readable texts, the input is analyzed for frequencies and coded into categories for building up inferences.\n",

       " <p lang=\"en\">WOW. I wasn't sure what to expect here considering I'm not a huge fan of most fusion food (it's usually too American-ized). We made this reservation the maximum days in advance (in the morning, because they usually fill up by the middle/end of the day) and got a spot on a Monday evening. We were early for our reservation but the party occupying our table hung out for awhile, so we didn't get seated until 10m or so past our designated time. <br/><br/>The restaurant decor is beautiful, but the layout is funky. The main pathway between the tables and the bar when you're walking towards the back is just slightly too narrow for two people to walk by each other at the same time. The bathroom is down a set of stairs. The kitchen design is open, and situated near the back of the restaurant.<br/><br/>We were so excited to come here, we ordered as many things as possible:<br/><br/>- tuna poke - wow. tuna was high quality and that nori cracker was something I've never had before. It was thick but incredibly crisp/crunchy, I imagine it's hard to get it to be this texture<br/>- beef tongue - their version of bao, not a huge fan and probably wouldn't order again. The flavor and texture of the tongue just wasn't working for me.<br/>- yellowtail sashimi - very similar to what I expected but also very delicious, might order again<br/>- tuna belly - I somehow was expecting this to come out cold and raw. It came out hot and cooked so my expectations were misaligned with reality. It seemed like high quality tuna but I'm not a huge fan of cooked tuna.. unless it's a tuna salad sandwich :).<br/>- scallops - absolutely delicious, the entire dish was not only beautifully presented, but unique and inventive, with an array of textures that was absolutely delightful<br/>- roasted octopus - eh, it was fine<br/>- spam (hidden menu) - I've never had homemade spam before and this was well worth it. It tasted like kielbasa sausage and was so packed with flavor. Don't go here without trying this. <br/>- manila clams - one of the best dishes we ordered. The sauce that it's in is similar to a Thai soup/curry and is delectable. The naan it comes with is surprisingly some of the best naan I've never had (it tastes homemade, it's so ridiculously soft). I'm not a huge clam person but we ordered this because one of my friends is.. and I would absolutely order this again. <br/>- beef ribs - again, not a huge fan of ribs but wow, these were tender, flavorful and this is another must-try on the menu.<br/><br/>For desert, we had that pineapple thing that everyone gets. It was good, but nothing amazing - we were also stuffed at this point, we overordered (no regrets) since we only had 3 people and ordered all the dishes above... service was great, in addition.<br/><br/>This place is insanely hard to get in to, and definitely on the expensive side, but worth a visit if you can get in. Just plan in advance.</p>,\n",

Then you have to wait in line and wish for good luck. Stop complaining. Don't want to line up? Go to the mall. You really want certain drop? Go to eBay. It's blessed enough no need to go to LA. <br/><br/>If you are not big into Supreme. Just want to check it out because it's super famous. Avoid Thursday and Friday.<br/><br/>Staffs are friendly. Be nice and be polite to them. Don't lose your manner from waiting. <br/><br/>Yeah it's in a bad neighborhood. That's the charm of San Francisco. Deal with it.<br/><br/>( Actually their LA location is way worse than SF. The amount of hustling and harassing people do near LA Supreme store make SF tenderloin looks like a beautiful place with beautiful people )<br/><br/>( This location is great. Supreme is more than a street fashion and skateboard brand. It's a culture, a game and a belief.  Market street is a wonderful area for Supreme. Perfect amount chaos and vivid living breath. If you can't deal with this then... what else I can say? Go to mall. )<br/><br/>( Tenderloin is the essential of SF. Stop hating this neighborhood. I love it. Very iconic location for Supreme to open. Good choice )</p>,\n",

They have a traditional Thai items on the menu along with unique items. We ordered two dishes based on the servers recommendations and were both very satisfied with what we ate: <br/>- Yum Moon and Goong: a salad with crispy pork belly, sliced apples, prawns and nuts. This dish has the perfect marriage of textures and flavors, from crispy, to crunchy, sweet, spicy and refreshing. <br/>- Crab fried Rice: served on a whole young coconut! They do not skim out on the crab and add plenty of eggs. Wasn't overly oily or salty. Awesome  dish! <br/>PS: their fruit infused water is effin DELICIOUS. <br/><br/>SERVICE: <br/>Mind readers! Before I was able to ask if we can move to a different table away from the direct sunlight - the server offered. Before I can ask if they can remove the humongous weave basket the fried rice came in; the server offered. Before I can ask for a water refill, the server offered. And need I say more about asking for the bill? <br/><br/>AMBIENCE:<br/>Very spacious and bright and hip. The only complaint I have is that the space lacks circulation and can be a bit stuffy. <br/><br/>Would return for other items!</p>,\n",

The quiche was to be lorraine, but I got the veggie instead because they ran out. Getting through the line was a bit confusing, but they are nice and helpful. It's a neat spot in West Portal.

Really great in-house ice cream with a nice selection of flavors to choose from. It's a super tiny spot, so it's likely you're in line out the door, but that's the standard for SF ice cream shops. It really doesn't matter what you get here because it's all pretty good and the good thing is that there's a good chance you'll find at least 2 flavors you want to get. Their ice cream is more on the creamy side, similar to Mitchell's. It's cash only, so make sure you bring a bit of it. Parking is always tough here, but if you're lucky enough to secure a spot, you're in for a treat.</p>,\n",

       " <p lang=\"en\">Side story: I was at a wine bar-- intimate setting, tables way too close to each other, you get the gist-- and could not stop myself from eavesdropping on the first date next to me...<br/><br/>-What's your go-to meal for dinner?<br/>-Honestly, pizza.<br/>[At this point I'm already like BE STILL MY HEART]<br/>-Oh........... Anywhere you'd recommend?<br/>-Detroit-style pizza is really hot right now so there's a lot of new places to check out. But I really like Pizza Squared.<br/>[I start nodding shamelessly like Yesss, SO hot right now. Like not nodding in my imagination... I'm actually nodding]<br/>-Oh what's that?<br/>[I might have even scowled, thinking asdfghjklkjhgfd you do not deserve to be on this date, scoot tf over!]<br/>-It's like Sicilian-adjacent, thick crust pizza with caramelized cheese along the crust. It's just really good.<br/>[Sicilian-adjacent?!?! *Gets ready to leave carbophobe bf for someone who finally KNOWS pizza*]<br/><br/>Ok just kidding about that last part, but the conversation had me so frikkin excited because I genuinely love pizza. I eat pizza more than I care to admit to myself (though my family sure doesn't hesitate to point it out). The thing is, I usually lay preference to thin crust Neopolitan or even NY-style pizzas, but lately I have been making an exception for the thicker Detroit-style because the caramelized cheese crust is just sooo goood. Historically these pizzas were cooked in steel car parts that allowed the cheese on the outer edges to get supa crispy. IMO it's even better than Chicago-style deep dish, which oftentimes can be way too doughy. I'm truly in such disbelief that I've been CRAVING thick pizza because it's really not my usual taste, but here we are.<br/><br/>I've eaten at the Detroit-style pizza places that are \"hot\" right now, and here's how I'd rank it:<br/>1. PIZZA SQUARED<br/>2. Cellarmaker House of Pizza<br/>3. Square Pie Guys<br/><br/>Why I don't like the other two as much:<br/>-I'm not embarrassed to admit that I eat by myself a lot. Not enough places serve pizza by the slice, but at Pizza Squared I can get two giant slices for less than $7.50 (Note: $7.25 for Detroit-style meat options, $6.50 for non-meat, or $7.50 for Sicilian style). At the other two, you have to COMMIT to 4 slices of one type of pizza at a higher price point (~$16-24 at Cellarmaker or ~$20-24 at Square Pie Guys). Even if I was hungry enough to eat 4 slices (or more), I'd get bored eating so much of the same type. Whether I'm ordering for myself or for a group, I like that I can get more variety just because the smaller serving sizes at Pizza Squared allow you to mix and match<br/><br/>-The cheesy crust at Pizza Squared is actually CRUNCHY like moon cheese or the burnt rim of a french onion soup. The crust at Cellarmaker is so chewy that my jaw gets exhausted, and the crust at SPG is sometimes not caramelized at all<br/><br/>-Pizza Squared just makes a better pizza, periodt. The sauce is tastier; flavorful from the subtle addition of Italian herbs/spices and naturally sweet from the tomatoes (some tomato sauces have no character). The cheese comes out gooey and stretches as you grab a slice (if they slice your pizza and the cuts don't get concealed by melty cheese, the pizza's too cold for you bro. *ahem* SPG). PLUS, the toppings options are a good range of simple to well-rounded. Admittedly at the other two places, nothing really spoke to me because there's kinda too much going on. I truly like every pie I've ordered at Pizza Squared.<br/><br/>My favorite flavors, in no particular order:<br/>-Pepperoni: A well-executed classic. I think my photo can make pepperoni porn a thing (if it isn't already)<br/>-Caramelized onion: GREAT non-meat option. I mean, read this description-- \"Caramelized onions, gruyere, mozzarella, garlic ricotta cream, chives\" oh fuck yeah.<br/>-Sausage mushroom: This one's Sicilian. HOMEMADE Italian sausage and criminis? I think I've ordered this each time I've eaten here.<br/>-Clam bacon: Chewy clams and crunchy bacon are a yummy texture party. But I'd be doing you a disservice if I didn't point out, is any clam pizza better than Golden Boy?<br/>-Vodka tomato cheese: Guys, my favorite pizza is a simple margherita so this is as plain as it gets but I still love it. Again, they sure know how to do a tomato sauce<br/>-Hawaiian: Yeah yeah, pineapple on pizza is controversial but you honestly cannot have a real pizza party without throwing some Hawaiian in the mix. I'm on team pineapple so this is solid.<br/><br/>I still prefer my thin crust pizzas but when I wanna carb out and eat a regular ol' American pizza, Pizza Squared has recently been my go-to. Only cons: Parking is limited in this area and you better be ready to reheat if you get delivery through Postmates. Also, if you come too close to closing time then they might be out of some options (but that's a lot of pizza places)</p>,\n",
